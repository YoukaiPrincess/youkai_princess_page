# My Personal Website

## *Made in the classic way (**html+css+js**)*

Yeah, The Indie Web resists!

### Issues to Solve

- [x] Is it working?

- [ ] Improve JS performance
- [x] Footer on blog pages
- [x] Container of the single post page
- [ ] Configure portfolio items

## The Questline

This kinda resumes my timeline during this project
Also delights some of my achievements

### Git Learnings

- Since I committed the whole folder, I must learn how to remove items selectively...
- This can be an opportunity to learn a bit more about how Git works
- The goal is to make everything through the terminal

    *It's not bad at all...*

### Making it again, but with shaders

Yes, the idea is to use some shaders here.
Once I want to use some JS libs to make browser games, it's a good idea to start training here

#### The goals are

- Make the rain effect with shaders
- Glyphicons in svg
- Make better outlining on the monitor screen
