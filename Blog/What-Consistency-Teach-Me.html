                                <p class="post-meta">_Date: March 6, 2024 | Author: Youkai Princess</p>

                                <h3>Consistency</h3>
                                <p>The act of keep moving on made me reach a place I've never seen, I just imagine how it would be like but I only realised when I looked back and said "wow, nice job girl!".</p>
                                
                                <p>It was hard, it was consuming and I was thinking that I wasn't capable of reaching certain grade of quality on my work. </p>
                                
                                <p>Until look back I was thinking that I've never be like those artists I follow and admire.</p>
                                <h3>Burning Out</h3> 
                                
                                <p>It was quick I would say. It took me 3 months to burn my mind out.</p>
                                <p>Of course, this period was the stress peak which made me had a burnout but the situation was going in this direction for a while before it.</p>
                                
                                <p>I could understand how small and also big content creators have burnout frequently.</p>
                                <p>Well, I was in the same route they follow. I studied their business to establish the pillars for my own business.</p>
                                
                                <h3>Finding a Way</h3>
                                
                                <p>But how can I reach the audience/algorithm expectations for frequency and quality if it takes me around 30 hours to make a 3D model?</p>
                                <p>This idea of posting everyday for growth is even an idea?</p>
                                
                                <p>Looking for a way to make things work for my side I found a interesting concept, at minimum. It was the kitbash, the art of packing 3D models in a way that you can disassemble parts to make a new model out of it or at least, speed up the process of making similar models.</p>
                                
                                <p>I liked the idea so much that I call it *kittybashing* </p>
                                
                                <h3>Reaching Talent</h3> 
                                
                                <p>When the situation demands, I can go well, even under pressure and not knowing the next steps I need to make.</p>
                                <p>I was compromised to make things faster so I changed my pipeline to accommodate this philosophy and it worked out even better than I expected!</p>
                                
                                <p>At the first time I could have some control over the outcomes of my works. I planned to reach a deadline and I reached it without any problems.</p>
                                
                                <h3>It's All About Practice</h3> 
                                
                                <p>This journey made me learn a lot about project management. This journey also made me see my whole career as a big life project.</p>
                                
                                <p>Doing things faster than I can do resulted in delaying even more my goals, that's why I put my practice in first place now.</p>
                                
                                <p>Practicing I could go way farther than I has been just producing.</p>
                                <p>Creating is important, but intention is what makes the creation something unique.</p>
