                                <h3>I've been here a countless times.</h3>
                                <p>I can't even remember how many times I passed through this whole process.</p>
                                <p>If I looped it, it's because at some point, I gave up.</p>
                                <p>And then, some time later, I tried again.</p>
                                
                                <p>This is a post about: Time, Projects, Expectations, Fresh Starts and Giving Ups.</p>
                                <p>In this post I'll bring my actual perspective over my past experiences of having a website and other personal online projects.</p>
                                
                                
                                <h3>First Websites</h3>
                                
                                <p>I see making websites as an art itself. How many different ways we can have to express information visually?</p>
                                
                                <p>I was that kid who always go through the most exotic websites, looking for exotic experiences.</p>
                                <p>With this background is not hard to realise that soon I'll be trying to do the same.</p>
                                
                                <p>In those good old days of the internet, was easy to find some inspiration and also easy to find resources to learn (how we ended with everybody trying to sell courses?). Eventually I found themes I would like to talk about and started making it real.</p>
                                
                                <p>Not for a specific reason, just because I like to do it. When I was a teenager I had a humour blog with a friend, it made me go farther than I would go alone...</p>
                                
                                <p>Along the time I wrote about Android, Videogames, Nature Sciences, Fiction and even Erotica. I had projects covering a lot of niches and writing was the common relationship between them.</p>
                                <p>But as easy I usually started these projects, was also easy to lose motivation and gave up.</p>
                                
                                
                                <h3>Why I Gave Up</h3>
                                
                                <p>I gave up. This is the best way to put it in words, I really gave up.</p>
                                
                                <p>I simply doesn't wanted to continue making the effort to make these texts a real thing. Now I understand why. </p>
                                
                                <p>I didn't want to make things because I'm committed to it, even things I love.</p>
                                <p>So I gave up
                                <p></p>
                                <h3>Working As Writer</h3>
                                
                                <p>As said before, I wrote about a lot of themes and the majority of them was made as work. At the time, l was half living the dream of making money out of something I love (and from home) but the other half was anxious about the work itself.</p>
                                
                                <h3>Giving Up</h3> 
                                
                                <p>As my skills grows I could see how unprepared I was. At the end of the day, I was just a teenager/young adult doing things.</p>
                                
                                <p>And when people start to pressure me to do what I'm already doing at my pace, I start to dislike doing it.</p>
                                <p>Putting in words, that's the reason I gave up so frequently. Even when I'm liking and doing well.</p>
                                
                                <h3>The Programming Monster</h3>
                                
                                <p>Programming is something you put your logical thinking in work to make circuits made of scripted functions that interact with itself. In my most direct reasoning, is something like this.</p>
                                
                                <p>For me, logical thinking is not a problem.  It's a pleasure!</p>
                                
                                <p>But again. When it comes to be a responsibility. When my actions are responsible for the outcome...</p>
                                
                                <p>I freeze...
                                <p></p>

                                <h3>Making Art</h3>
                                
                                <p>Some years ago, during the lockdown I was locked in with myself. I had a lot of new perceptions about myself, it includes my gender transition but doesn't limit itself at it.</p>
                                
                                <p>Looking at what I like and would be my dream, my passion to chase as career, I came to an obvious conclusion.</p>
                                
                                <h3>VIDEO GAMES</h3>
                                
                                <p>What about make my childhood dreams come true?</p>
                                <p>It evolves a lot of hard-to-earn skills, huh?</p>
                                <p>And I already have much of these skills, right?</p>
                                <p>So, why not?</p>
                                
                                <p>Looking back, I feel a bit dumb and naÃ¯ve for thinking like this. But now, at the moment I'm writing it I feel proud of myself.</p>
                                
                                <p>Not everyone decides to chase a purpose and even with unfavourable conditions, go on.</p>
                                
                                <p>I didn't gave up already...</p>
                                <p>I'm at this point right now. Fighting with myself</p>
                                
                                <h3>How Stopping Made Me Change My Mind</h3>
                                
                                <p>When you do different things, you can reach a certain ability to anticipate some outcomes. Because you had a lot of distinct experiences, you start to see some patterns, even where these patterns should mean nothing.</p>
                                
                                <p>Every time I stopped to do something I like, it gave me time to find other things to like too.</p>
                                <p>And these accumulated experiences in different areas made me different too.</p>
                                
                                <p>That's why I gave so much value to the rest now. If you don't stop, you can't perceive the things in motion because you're in motion.</p>
                                
                                <h3>Choosing The Right Battles</h3>
                                
                                <p>And it takes me to where I am now!</p>
                                <p>Trying, learning, making mistakes and cool crafts.</p>
                                
                                <p>Only after getting lost I could understand why I was running in circles all this time.</p>
                                <p>    That's the key. The time!</p>
                                
                                <p>Only focusing my time in the things that fulfil my needs and aspirations in life, only focusing my time, energy and focus in what makes my soul sparks... That's the only way to live a life I am proud of...</p>
                                
                                <p>So that's why I'm here â™¥</p>
