                                <h3>I Knew It's Hard, But That's Insane</h3>

                                <p>Was pretty hard to understand myself as a transgender girl, who have lived a boy's life just because of circumstances. ~~born with a dick~~</p>
                                
                                <p>It makes a lot of sense if I look back in every aspect of my life, so I made this change.</p>
                                <p>I'm a practical person. If it solves some issues in my perception of myself, I do it. My major interest in life is to improve myself.</p>
                                
                                <p>What I didn't knew (besides imagining it) is that my life will turn into a nightmare in the moment I put a skirt and go out.</p>
                                
                                <h3>The Little Terrors Of Quotidian Life</h3>
                                
                                <p>The situation itself puts me in a strange position. I am me, but if I express myself in a way that express what I have inside, I got repression, rejection, hate...</p>
                                
                                <p>The way people look at me is the worst part because it's so frequent that sometimes it's almost funny. I feel like Naruto in his village...</p>
                                
                                <p>Having people who treated me so sweetly now turn their faces to not talk to me, some changing sidewalks to don't cross my way or even strangers making the catholic cross sign when see me in a dark alley...</p>
                                <p>These things changed something in me, I don't know what, but I know something changed.</p>
                                
                                <p>I will not mention the sexual harassments or the explicit sexual desired directed to my person.</p>
                                
                                <h3>New Game Plus</h3>
                                
                                <p>Everything remains the same for me. I do almost the same activities, go to almost the same places...</p>
                                <p>Even my routine living as a girl changed much how I live. Maybe I just increased the frequency of self care, but in a larger context, I can't even say something really changed in my life.</p>
                                
                                <p>n other side, my life became really difficult in aspects that I never had problems before.</p>
                                <p>Anything requiring my documents is now a trigger for anxiety.</p>
                                <p>I see people bugging while don't know how to treat me. I respect it and feel respected, but causing problems to others makes me feel bad anyways.</p>
                                <p>I also developed a syndrome or something similar. I have a hard resistance to getting out of home. ~~looks like I get traumatized~~</p>
                                <p>When I go outside, going beyond the need to stay private, I always cover my body the maximum possible. Using hoodies under a temperature of +30ºC like crazy.</p>
                                
                                <h3>The Price of Joy</h3>
                                
                                <p>In my perception, my gender transition can be seen as a **skin changing**.</p>
                                <p>Or a kind of bodybuilding, because well, I'm in fact building my body to shape it in a way that satisfies me.</p>
                                
                                <p>I am happy and satisfied with my body and appearance, it doesn't happened before.</p>
                                <p>Now I can see the life in a different perspective, now I can really feel the life...</p>
                                
                                <p>Why I need to have so many trouble for choosing to be myself regards what people expect from me? People doesn't usually say they don't care about what others do with their lives?</p>
                                <p>So why I pass through these random bad situations?</p>
                                
                                <h3>Society</h3>
                                
                                <p>But when you change the gender you didn't choose at first, looks like people get mad at you...</p>
                                
                                <p>The homie J.P. Sartre would say that my problem is with *my self in world*. But I don't know exactly where my self problems are originated by the world or triggered by the problems the world see in myself.</p>
                                
                                <p>I don't know, I really don't know. I don't even know why I'm really posting it.</p>
                                But it's here, anyway
